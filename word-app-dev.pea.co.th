Soon after we entered Hounſlow-heath, and called at Witton, which belonged formerly to the duke of Argyle. The duke was the greateſt connoiſſeur in trees of any man in England; and naturalized great numbers. He piqued himſelf on having his trees in the greateſt perfection. If a tree did not

From Witton we proceeded through Twic

kenham; where the garden of Pope is ſtill ſhewn, in the ſtate in which he left it. It is ſurprizing to ſee ſuch an effort of real taſte, at a time, when the country was barbarous in all it's ideas of gardening. He is ſaid to have been aſſiſted by Kent; but I think it not at all a determined point, whether he did not give Kent more aſſiſtance than he received. Pope certainly aſſumed to himſelf the merit of forming this piece of ground; and uſed often to ſay, with perhaps ſome

As we leave Twickenham, the Thames opens beautifully, and forms a fine reach. But notwithſtanding it's beauty, and even grandeur—the richneſs of it's banks—and the gorgeous villas, that crown them, it ſtill falls ſhort, in a pictureſque light, of a Scotch river, with all it's rough accompaniments, pouring over rocks, and forming a thouſand little foaming eddies. The eye, ſo long in the habit of admiring the wild ſcenes of na
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ture, cannot eaſily forget thoſe inchanting images. Every kindred object raiſes a recol
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
lection of the paſt; and every recollection, a compariſon, in which the tame, tho inriched ſcenes of art are ſure to ſuffer.
</p>
<p>
To enumerate only in a catalogue, the ſe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
veral ſplendid villas, that adorn even this part of the Thames, would be tedious. What
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1040100202:202"/>
is chiefly the object of a ſtranger's notice is Mr. Walpole's houſe at Strawberry-hill. He has rebuilt it (for it was before an old man
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſion) in the Gothic ſtyle, as the moſt proper receptacle for the many curious, and rich remains of antiquity, with which it is adorned. But through the inability of his architects, particularly of Langley (who, tho eſteemed capital in his day, knew nothing of the art of conſtructing modern Gothic) his ideas were never properly executed. Mr. Walpole often complained they were rather Mooriſh, than Gothic: however, as he could not, at that day, procure better aſſiſtance, he was obliged to acquieſce in what he could not amend. He was always however among the firſt to depreciate his own architecture.
</p>
<p>
With regard to the inſide of his houſe, he early ſaw that inſipid taſte prevailing, which is now ſo general, of adorning walls, and cielings, with light, faint, gaudy colours; and endeavoured to introduce a tone of har
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
mony into his apartments; and to relieve the furniture by an oppoſition of colour in the rooms, where it was placed. He always how
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ever lamented, that he fell ſhort of his own deſigns: but ſtill he raiſed the admiration
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1040100202:203"/>
of others, who had a leſs accurate taſte than he had himſelf; and were pleaſed with ſome
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
thing, which they could not account for.
</p>
<p>
The garden contains about ten acres. It conſiſts of a lawn, and open grove; and is conſidered only as a foreground to a beau
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
tiful bend of the Thames, and the landſcape beyond it, which diſplays ſome of the rich diſtances in that neighbourhood—very unlike indeed the grand, and ſimple views, we had ſeen in the highlands of Scotland; but more aſſimilated to the character of a ſouthern coun
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ty. A Scotch landſcape beyond the rich views of the Thames, would be as abſurd in a picture, as it would be unnatural in a real view.
</p>
<p>In an angle of the garden ſtands a Gothic chapel, containing a lofty, rich ſhrine of ancient Moſaic, which is exceedingly curious.</p>
<p>
But tho the houſe is richly adorned with remains of antiquity, which preſent them
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſelves in every apartment; yet they are a ſmall part of thoſe rarer productions of art— drawings—medals—enamels—and miniatures, which are contained in cabinets. In the three laſt articles eſpecially, moſt of which

Since the laſt ſheet of this work was printed, I have received ſome circumſtances with regard to the affair of Paul Jones (mentioned in the 105th page of the ſecond volume) which I am de
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſired to add.
</p>
<p>
Soon after the ſhips left the bay, Jones informed Lord Selkirk by a letter, that he avowed indeed the intention of carrying his lordſhip off; but with a deſign merely to get a cartel eſtabliſhed, through the means of ſuch a priſoner. As to taking the plate, he ſaid, he totally diſavowed it: his crew forced him to it; being determined to have a little plunder, for the riſk they had run both in Kircudbright-bay; and in attempting, the night before, to burn the ſhipping at Whitehaven.—To this apology Jones added a promiſe to reſtore the plate; which, on the peace, ſeven years after the depredation, was punctually performed, It was put into the hands of Lord Selkirk's banker in London; and not the leaſt article was miſſing.—This reſtitution has the appearance of gene
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
roſity: but I think it probable, that Jones might feel for his pro
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
feſſional character, which he found would ſuffer under the infamy of ſuch a pilfering tranſaction.

<head>ACCOUNT OF THE PRINTS.</head>
<p>
WITH regard to the prints, which adorn theſe volumes, I can only ſay, what I have ſaid of thoſe in other publications of the ſame kind; that few of them pretend to be
<hi>exact portraits.</hi>
They in general
<hi>
only charac
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
terize the countries,
</hi>
through which the reader is carried. They were ſlightly taken in the courſe of a haſty journey; and at beſt meant only to preſerve the great lines of the country: and even this, I fear not always accurately. I have heretofore made confeſſion to the public, that when I have ſeen a line out of place, I have a great propenſity to correct it by one that is more pictureſque.
</p>
<p>
I would not however wiſh theſe drawings to be conſidered merely as the effuſions of
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:1040100202:207"/>
fancy. In thoſe views, in which the features are ſtrong, and prominent, as in the approach to Edinburgh, to Sterling, and to Dunbarton, I hope,
<hi>the character of the place</hi>
is tolerably con
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
veyed; in others, which offer nothing ſtriking,
<hi>the character of the country</hi>
only is attempted.
</p>
<p>
But indeed, on ſo ſmall a ſcale, it would be impoſſible to give an adequate idea of a grand ſcene. However exact the portrait might be, yet under ſuch paltry dimenſions, the eye would revolt againſt the idea of grandeur. Were it painted indeed with exactneſs on a pane of glaſs in a window, and the eye brought to it, under the deception of it's being a real view; the imagination might aggrandize it. But I am clearly of opinion, that without deception, a few inches of paper can never give any thing like an adequate idea of gran
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
deur.
</p>
<p>
And here I am glad of an opportunity of mentioning a ſet of Scotch views, which will ſoon be publiſhed; and will intirely ſuper
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſede any portraits, which at beſt I could have given. They are on the large ſcale of twenty-five inches by eighteen; which is both a good ſize, and a good proportion. And tho prints even of this magnitude are nothing,
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:1040100202:208"/>
when compared to the grand ſcenes of nature; yet as they are larger than prints of landſcape commonly are, the eye gives them ſome cre
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dit for the dimenſions they repreſent. Theſe views were drawn, (and, I believe, will be etched,) by Mr. Joſeph Farington.
</p>
<p>
I am not in the leaſt acquainted with that artiſt: but as I have admired ſeveral of his prints from the drawings, he made on the lakes of Cumberland, and Weſtmoreland; I cannot forego the pleaſure of mentioning theſe Scotch views, which I doubt not will be in the ſame ſtile of excellence. Mr. Farington's ſcheme is very extenſive, comprehending ſe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
veral parts of Scotland: but the views he now offers to the public, are taken from the ſcenery about Edinburgh, Sterling, and the banks of the Forth; which are, ſo far, in the direct rout deſcribed in theſe pages; and I ſerve myſelf in mentioning them. They are an appendix to my work. Theſe views, I under
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ſtand alſo by the propoſals, will ſtill be ren
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dered more valuable by explanatory deſcriptions of each by Mr. Knox of the antiquarian ſociety at Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>
But tho in compariſon with ſuch grand views, as I take it for granted theſe will be,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1040100202:209"/>
I ſpeak contemptibly of my own
<hi>diminutive</hi>
drawings; yet I hope I may offer them to the public with ſome little confidence, as
<hi>pictures</hi>
at leaſt as far as they go, tho not as exact
<hi>portraits.</hi>
Of the free, and elegant manner, in which they are executed by Mr. Alkin in aquatinta, who compleated the whole work himſelf, I can ſpeak with great aſſurance. He has given me much ſatisfaction; and I hope he will give equal ſatisfaction to the public. The elegance of his workmanſhip makes up for the defects of the drawings.

Among the Errata of theſe volumes I think it proper to correct an error of more conſequence in a ſimilar work, which I have no other means of correcting. In the preface to ſome pictureſque obſervations I lately publiſhed on the Lakes and Mountains of Cumberland, and Weſtmoreland, I aſſert (p. 16) that
<hi>
Gothic ar
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
chitecture is no where found, but in England; except in ſuch parts of France, as were in poſſeſſion of the Engliſh.

I have ſince found this to be a miſtake. I had ſuppoſed indeed, that all the old buildings on the Continent, were of a kind of anomalous architecture, very different from what we denominate Gothic in England. But a friend, who had contributed to lead me into the miſtake, has ſince led me out of it. He is a good judge of Saxon and Gothic architecture in their various combi
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
nations; and informs me in a letter from Germany, that the great church at Cologne, which he had examined on the ſpot, is very much in the ſtyle of York-minſter; tho upon a more ample plan. The cathedral too at Ulm is pure Gothic; tho the ori
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
ginal plan neither there, nor at Cologne is compleated. The great chruch at Auxerre in Burgundy he thought at leaſt equal in elegance to any Gothic building he had any where ſeen; tho it wants the grandeur of the lengthened iſle. Even the cathe
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
dral of Milan he found true Gothic. In ſhort, he traced that ſtile of architecture not only in the cathedrals, but in the pariſh-churches, through France, Germany, and Italy, as far as Naples.—The
<hi>hiſtory</hi>
of Gothic architecture appears to me there
<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
fore to be very little known. We can trace Grecian and Roman architecture, howewer ſcattered through Europe, to one common origin: but where ſhall we ſeek the origin of Saxon, and Gothic?
